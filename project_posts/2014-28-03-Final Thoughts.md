<b>Final Thoughts</b>

Great to have been a part of competition.  Learned a ton.
Thought I'd end with why my project should win.  It probably shouldn't but here's why it should.

<li>Simple. Simple. Simple.

<li>Universal.

<li>Can be shown anywhere.

<li>Can be taken anywhere.

<li>Unicode is important.

I have various different ideas for how this might play out in an installation.  Its pretty straight-forward.  Just a matter of trying to figure out how many stations of Unicode exploration you might want.  The space allotted isn't very big so I don't imagine too much.  I see four aspect:

abstract chrome art

display current fontsets in different neato displays

history of unicode and google font api

advertising

Bundle all that into a little information center.  Where people from everywhere and who speak every language will find something interesting.
