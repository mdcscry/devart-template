Here is the link for the first flasher.  It lives in the browser...so Code is available for view in the browser.    This version has been "souped-up" with an hsla random color generator.  Original version from 2013 didn't use this neat feature.  I also added some additional glyphs for 
devArt--Hangul in particular.
