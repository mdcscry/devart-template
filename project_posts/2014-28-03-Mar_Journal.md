March3-Mar 7   

After reading my sad comments about not caring about Mozilla, I Ported website to Firefox.  Firefox doesn’t have filters or webkit-stroke properties.  Rothko Blur (http://glyphmatic.us/?i=07) doesn’t workI work for a while to implement SVG blur within framework and it blew up chrome..  I’d like to get back to it.  I think I just need some additional conditional (?) to account for it. But I moved on.  Opera is beautiful just like Chrome.  Its really a webkit project.  Mac, Opera and Chrome.  I still don’t care about IE, except that I think about porting to IE every day.  I think this means you can’t trust me when I say I don’t care about browser compliance.  Although, I do think the artistic component of this work, could and I underline could, argue for ignoring these standards strictly for ignoring sake.  ALL best practice is created for reuse, stability, efficiency—who cares?  Sounds like a bunch of business types merged with pointy headed code idealists telling me how to make art.   I’m not sure I believe this.  But I think it.

Mar 5th

Looked at the websocketsAPI
Implemented cross-fade in Chrome.  Firefox doesn’t work quite right. http://glyphmatic.us/?i=09.

Mar 9th

Studied Modernizr, embedding fonts (yes I wanted to thunk my forehead after realizing how easy it is.)
Mar 10th
Got totally geeked on Clojure.  If nothing else you all can pat yerselves on the back for getting us all to study new things.  Read about HDF5, Processing.js.  found haptic-data.com and studied their examples.

Mar 11-12th 

Discovered the term Stimergy.  Read about arity.   Hadn’t ever heard that term before.  Clojure! Functional programming.   Visited Casey Reas’ website and reviewed his great work.  Marvellous.  I feel like my stuff fits into his genre.
Visited SIL website(http://www-01.sil.org/) and downloaded and installed a number of Arabic fonts.  This begins a number of days of ancient font exploration.  Got the Anatolian hieroglyphics and the Crete-Minoan hieroglyphs implemented--Pretty interesting.  Much like the Maya, the shapes are non standard glyph shapes.  When enlarged, they also create unfamiliar web visual patterns.  I want to give George Douros a big kiss.  Metaphorically speaking. 
Spent more time beginning study of different scripts living and dead unencoded and encoded.  Fascinating obscure line of study.  Here I found my previous enhancement request from above to include Tarot Cards has been answered—prior to my asking which is how it should be. http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11216-n4089-playingcards.pdf.
Once again found myself at the script encoding initiative website for further study into Ms. Anderson’s work.  Read the initiatives for Rohingya, Anatolian Heiroglyphs, Elbasan (Albanian), Palmyrene, Manichaean, more Cuneiform, Pau Cin Hau and Blissymbolics(wow), tangut and Oracle Bone script.  Reviewed proposals for new characters in Pipeline table. Reviewed as-yet unsupported scripts.  As a stated at beginning, this work is a restriction study.  The more new characters, especially of dead languages, that can be added, gives me more to work with.  I’m all for it.  
I like the TIP roadmap names  Oracle Bone Script (Ellison should sponsor), Bronze Script, small seal script.  Easier to remember than Meirotic Cunieform..
Found about 15 more interesting lookup charts for the various forms of symbols across sets.Measurement,punctuation, units, data, numbering, timezones, duration.  So much metadata.  Finally ended with a brief study of the core spec.
Mar 13th
Tetragrammaton implemented in Symbolquad.  Also added dove, added Tao han glyph. Reworked some of the OM’s.  Began multi-day effort to include.
Made a tiny effort to alter Spirali (http://glyphmatic.us/?i=03) to use translate transform instead of Left and Top to move the glyphs around.  Couldn’t get it working within the 20 minute test and backed it out.  I’d be interested to see if I can’t get this working some other time.  Good time to mention the painter qualities of Spirali are apparent in Canary but not Chrome.  Not sure why.

Mar 14-18

Fiber arts time.  Made D&D dice bag for the boy.  []
More Fiber arts.  OM specific symbol quad for friends 60th birthday
	Learned to use the narrow hammer foot on my sewing maching.  Not sure how dev art turned into sewing.  I made a decision around this time, to make the art that I wanted to make.  I could have spent time trying to implement some falutin software or another, to enhance the project.  But that’s not what was moving me.  So I did the fiber arts projects that was.  Translating Glyphmatic.us into an artifict outside of the computer, is one of my goals.  I have a long history of sewing and fiber arts projects.  I want each piece to be one of a kind.  Sending out for prints was a boondoggle.  I didn’t like either of the tests I sent out for…pretty expensive failures.  Sooooo, I’ve gone native.  Plus I like the Arts and Crafts nature of 1-offs.  Yes, I like the Roadshow.
Mar 19th
Added the Ik Onkar and the Bengali Oms, anchor, ankh, and a few others to Symbol quad. Zarathustrianism has long been an interest.  I see the Faravhar is.not included in Unicode.  Enhancement request!  Still need to finish with Alpha and Omega.  
Saw that one competitor has included his app in the Chrome App store.  Wonder if this might help with my Font install problem.  Not going to find out before Mar. 28th.
Not sure why I’m so set on finding all these particular symbols, but I’m enjoying it.  The number of glyphs has increased to a point that each time I refresh it looks pretty different.

Mar 20th

Yes, after a month and a half, I found Noto.  An honest to goodness API a uncode artist can apppreciate.  

Mar 21th
Duck typing.  I noticed Facebook released a new strongly typed python extension and went down the rabbit hole on typing.

Mar 24th
An extended session of fiber arts

Mar 25-28th
Finishing up implementing noto and google fonts api.  Finishing up.
I got the api working here
http://glyphmatic.us/googleAPItest.htm
Added Cardo added to main website here
http://glyphmatic.us/?i=06
http://glyphmatic.us/?i=11
