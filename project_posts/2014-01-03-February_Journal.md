 ![tripperalien](../project_images/tripperalien.jpg?raw=true "Tripperalien")After entering the competition, I had to start studying.  Like the well-known horror of writing something you like, showing it to an editor you respect. I realized after signing up that I was a Unicode hack. 
 
 First, some backstory.  I’d created two new engines in the days preceding my finding the devart contest.  One combined large webkit stroke width and huge mayan glyphs.   I’d stumbled on the Mayan glyphs in the supplemental private use area A sectiont.  Without thinking, I had downloaded the Mayan font some weeks earlier from [this](http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/ “Ancient Font download Page") collection of ancient fonts. Combing through for signs of glyph life, I spotted the Mayan glyphs.  A combining system, this set has highly irregular glyph shapes.  Enlarging them and including the over-sized css webkit stroke width made for the most exciting visual designs I’d managed to get yet.
 
 [MayanExplosian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC6ucOHSFI4,"Mayan Explosian") (sound). 
 
 I was ha.p.py.  I took that engine and started rotating the large font divs, around all three axis creating Tripper.
 
 [trippy](http://youtu.be/KMvKyON3C08 "Tripper").   

Both of these finds resulted from a re-start of my work on the glyphmatic.us after 5 months off.  The great Boulder floods of 2013 bombed my basement and I lost the mental space to work.  Now, it could be said that picking the edge finish on the new vanity purchased to replace the previously perfectly good vanity has its charm and benefits to marital relations (bullnose), but finally, I was pumped again for the right reasons..  Entranced in my little dev-ecstasy, I stumbled across this contest on metafilter. 

This isn’t a truly web-based  project, but I do want people to see the glyphs.  Here and therein is my challenge.  Few regular web users have the necessary fonts.  [Heiroglyphics](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U13000.pdf  “Heiroglyphics”) are a good example.  I'm still just starting to design with this huge set of glyphs.  I time-travel when I look at them.  But nobody has [Aegyptus](http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/ “Aegyptus") on their computer.  Well, Unicode ancient font freaks might; and I think we can all agree to the various sociological maladies this obviously reflects.  Anyway, this makes the web a good but limited canvas...  

Looking back at my web history for February shows I was running the experiments pretty regularly.  I had been stringing them all together using meta-refresh.  As I was going along, I was updating and fixing--pure mindless art fun.  An engine can be tweaked a 1000 different ways and any different font-set applied.  My formal website engine is a little more challenging (not mindless art fun) to add to, so this stringing together was an easy way to see all the experiments and a simple path to create never-ending, never repeating looping computer-made art. I imagine glyphmatic.Us on display permanently, randomly producing the worlds glyphs.  The computer makes the art, not the people.  I call it associative disorder art. Also, offsourcing. 
 
My euphoria of getting back to it and finding something exciting was covering-up the utter dismay I was feeling about glyphmatic.us.  It looked good in XP Chrome and nowhere else. In Chrome on windows 7 and 8 large skewed objects disappear on fullscreen. My reduced fontset wasn’t appearing in new windows machines in a native font install, either.  I needed to do significant reworking and debugging. Many glyphs weren't appearing in Android.  I reduced the glyph set (again)--remaining unfinished but better. I finally checked on i-products at the local blue box and was pleasantly surprised..  Writing for webkit on Windows ports well to Android and Safari.  But in the end, I'm still limited in my fonting(verb); its not the whole experience of Unicode.  That’s why I need the Barbicon's walls.  

Withn’t a lick of further ado, the February web history journal:

####Mon. February 3:
  * Glyphmatic.us runs local all night with from starting with flasher1. 

####Tues. Feb 4:
  * Review filters available-Looking for Emboss
  * Reviewed material about embedding fonts in webserver
  * Reviewed AWS approach to embedded font
  * testing continuous play of glyphmatic.us studies
  * Reviewed color printer options for fabric printing
  * Reallocated my 401k
  * Read 7 gestures to make you look like a real intellectual in wired.
  * Kicked off continuous 5:35PM
  * Found missing fonts 10:08
  * Re-downloaded code2001 from awesome James Kass
  * Reviewed the middle earth fonts therein!!
  * Reviewed alan wood’s website once again for varying code pages
  * Discovered the Maya script in supplemental area
  * Got stoked.  

####Wed. February 5:
  * It appears around 10:30 in the morning, my attention was diverted from actual work and I downloaded the new tailu font.
  * I see around this time I implemented the balijavatibet font selection.  Created new engine. Need to rework and make individual or just balijava
  * No pictures of this..not very good?  Used same engine with byzantine musical notes.  Interesting design engine for “Musical” art.  Notes look like notes but are obviously different.
  * I looked up the pronunciation of Picosecond.  My new CIO gave a three hour talk, which inspired confidence.  His mispronounciation of picosecond, did not. Pie-co second?
  * Pre Ordered a canvas and a canvas banner with glyphmatic.us printing.  WE’ll see.
  * Reminded myself how to use the alt-x and hex to get the interrobang‽
  * For some reason, I tried to include Unicode characters in OneNote.  I don’t use OneNote.
  * I reviewed the css animation properties and started mucking around with flasher27.
  * Tripper was born.
  * Made a Tangine.
  * Took new Maya engine and hooked in MPH 2B Damase Unicode font, which has an unusual non-standard font stroke.  Not as unusual as Maya but unique.  I plugged into the large glyph engine but then pushed it into a quad glyph presentation standard engine.  The glyph stroke and the sets available in MPH 2B Damase are neat.O.
  
####Thurs. February 6: 
  * Hooked the Yi Radicals into the maya flasher39 engine.  More straight line, but still non-standard.
  * Still testing end to end run.  Adding in all these additions to flasher27 and flasher39 engines.
  * Implemented HSLA random color function.  C.a.n.t. believe I waited so long.
  * Read about pineapple express hitting California.  Worried Franco is confused. 
  * found desk to buy(flood related)
  * Looks like I spotted the announcement for the contest on Metafilter  sometime around 8pm.
  * Hit github at 8:21pm
  * Worked getting set up till 1:15, read Unicode chronology and history again before going to bed.  Ladies and gentlemen, still a hack.  But a hack with pretty colors.
  
####Sat. February 8:
  * Had spoken to co-worker zedi about collaboration with designer brother in Karachi. Had shown him Maya Flasher39 and flasher27. He liked.  Mentioned his brother might be interested in doing something with the images.  Aha!  I thought I’d study my previous attempts with Arabic. Show him I meant businesss.
  * Got full glyph set prepared.
  * Tried cam studio video capture software.  Not too good.
  * My wife checked her Garnet Hill order--not sure why she's using my computer.
  * Added an Ugaritic version of degenerator6
  * Began to write history of my work with devArt and random
  * Studied wayback machine and looked at my previous webart work starting in 1998.
  * Fun.
  * More site messing.  Github changes wasn’t getting synched to the public site.  Kinda confusing
  * Still end to end testing
  * It appears I continued to check the devart site.
  * Looks like this is about when I get pissed my site is so screwed up.
  * Banged on Github until 12:00am.  Think I figgerd it out.  Geez.  Oh, source code control.
  
####Sun. February 9:
  * Stayed away from computer except to check weather until evening.
  * End to end testing ran successfully all day.  Computer fan a runnin.  
  * Checked the NOAA forecast discussion multiple times.  Must a been weather.
  * Suddenly investigated innerHtml 9:35PM.  Still upset transparancy can't be applied.
  * Flasher14 was running.  Not sure the two events are correlated.
  * Altered standard8_retro.js.  Automated CSS code file.  Mandala setting?  Not sure
  * Looks like website anger is boiling.  Opening up glyphtester scripts for glyphtester logo set.
  * Has to be reduced.  Multiple glyphs not appearing on most standard platforms.
  * Also started research on why glyphs disappear under certain circumstances.
  
####Mon. February 10:
  * Apparently I’m looking for jobs in Kerala.  Mighty interesting society that.
  * Sent Zedi screen shots.
  * Looked at css-background transparency properties.  Key to flying glyphs and many other features‽
  * Looked at the original flasher35-arabic study
  * reviewed line-spacing and line-height css properties …again
  * Banged on the site till midnight.  Goodnight.
  
####Tues. Feb 11:
  * Found this http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=1067319&objectId=3402039&partId=1
  * My People!
  * Figure that gives me a tent of an artistic tradition to put my sleepsack under, but further search for a “school” of letter art, not so much.
  * Looks like I spent the morning learning github markdown.  I suppose this could arguably be a benefit to my company at some time.
  * It does appear though, in the afternoon, work did bleed over into art.   My coworkers led by Vamsi came across a data issue in transferring customer data from iseries through db2 ods into Teradata.  The iseries had an old ebicdc code page, the db2 was utf-8 and Teradata was iso-5885 or whatever.  So here,  I had to/got to read about backward the compatibility (new band) UTF affords iso codepage users..except for ctl-char.  I-series control characters are a pernicious etl tse-tse fly.  Puts ya to sleep..if you know what I mean?  The varchar length was 40 across all three platforms.  A particular row with a 40char length (awesome, I know) also had a ctl-char.(woot..)  
When this tse-tse fly of a line hit, UTF-8, it blew up because UTF codes ctl-char as 2byte not 1, as the other two do.  A brilliant set of circumstances, but a fantastic Unicode real world example.  Imagine my excitement.  Vamsi iterates that we hit this kind of intracacy every.single.year.  I agree with him. Duly.
  * Insert 2 page treatise on wild realization. Unicode isn’t just for humans anymore..
  * Ha!HA!  Yes boss, I was working.
  * After work, it looks like I started a study of the Unicode site starting with Japan and Korea.  
  * Looked at the Unicode Regular Expressian (from the land of…) release from last year.  Could this be any geekier?
  * I heart regular expressions although I’m have some bitterness about about how crappy I am at them. But heart can sometimes be that way; when even supplicant admission to regular expression studded perl one-liner godhood.. fails.   
  * Visited the Unicode mailing list page. Daunted by the seriousness.  If I had doubts before about my seriousness…we’ve enhanced them.  This is me in WATB mode.
  * Reviewed a thread on the astrological glyph for Neptune.  Who doesn’t need to know this?
  * Which allowed me to take the awesome opportunity to visit the uranian-institute.org for further study.  I don’t remember this.
  * Aha, back to regular expression release.  And a stimulating discussion of line-breaking algorithms.  The BUILTIN nuance of Unicode is difficult to put in words.  I'll posit that most of us take our line-breaking algorithms for granted.  Because the Unicode Consortium is covering our asses.  Thanks team.  From everybody.  I mean it, pretty much everybody. 
  * Idea for glyph set  “Animals of Unicode”.  For the kids.  Also and too.  “Faces of Unicode”: for the non-abstractionists among us.  This would be for the folks who don’t really like the “Huh?Art” movement.**
  *  **Not an real Art movement.  
  * Read additional realeases and bulletins including one regarding Henry Luce foundation grant to Unicode consortium for the TANGUT language.   http://unicode-inc.blogspot.com/2013/09/henry-luce-foundation-grant-to-unicode.html
  * Raises option of making case for donation to UNICODE consortium’s efforts as part of installation.  i.e. showing languages both without fonts and without established encodings.
  * Studied punycode and the IDNA compatibility issues surrounding domain names.  Again, the tentacles of Unicode astound me. Real world applications.  
  * I enjoy political and socialogical implications of a bunch of white guys forgetting that 5 billion other people might want websites named with their own freaking glyphsets.  Classic.  
  * And now I know why the crazy Russian website names look like they do.  Not sure that helps me.  Maybe those aren’t all spammers.  They probably are.
  * Departing dramatically from punycode and IDNA compatibility, I looked at Baybayin again. One of the original languages of the Philippines, my co-worker Jean knew this to be her language prior to the mean ole Spaniards showed up.  Endless fascination to be found in the languages and glyphs from the islands.
  * Then to the Moji_Joho collection, and finally Telugu and Arabic ligatures.  I should note, its Tuesday and Zedi didn’t say a word and didn’t look at me during the workday.  Ug.  He hated it.  Instead of taking this as an adequate sign I was headed in the wrong direction.. I began a deep dive into URDU.  Spent 3 hours until 2 in the morning working on Urdu specific Unicode.
  
####Wed. Feb 12
  * Downloaded iphone/ipad emulator.  Still struggling with web programming.  I d.o.n.t. want to have to make IE work.  I don’t give a rip about Mozilla.  Okay. I did say that.  This is a google contest.  Right?  Furtherless, My code is messy.  I don’t code to code, I code to make art.  If you look at my code and its too messy for you.  Send money, I will code to spec for food.  But really I’m a recreational coder.  I don’t code professionally any more.  Ruins the fun.  I do data. 
  * Happy that webkit translates so well to safari.  Big smile.  Iphones and tablets have a little better font coverage than my nexus devices. I still have misses.  Especially spiral experiment on site.
  * Looked at chromium, downloaded canary.  Trying to figure out if Extreme Stroke Width functions any better in Canary..not really.  Still disappears on full screen.  Visible when screen reduced, fewer when maximized, fewer when full screen.  P.i.s.s.i.n.g. me off.  I love the effect.
  * Looked at box flex and flow CSS..no dice.
  * Wrote history for dev art site, updated summary and picture.  No synching‽  I update github, private site shows update but public site not showing.  No info, guessing I have it right and need to await synch..
  * Pivot to freebaseAPI and finished by visiting Barbican site falling asleep to dreams of whirld travel. 
  * Woke up 4:21am refreshed glyphmatic.us.  Not normal.
  
####Thurs Feb 13:
  * Checked out a couple of competitors sites.  Love all the ideas.  Wonder about my little simple programs amidst the hoopla of social interaction and wearable computing.  
  * Stumbled on 3-d jewelry and other stuff site.  Head blows up.  What is glyphmatic.us?  What does it matter? The projects described in devart and this 3d printing gnoo-bender we’re on doesn’t inspire confidence in my project’s rising to the proper whiz bang level I think is probably going to win this thing..  Spose I’ve got to hold to the importance of UNICODE in everything we do to drive a context deeper than the super-fun and estimable sensual titillation associated with using a computer to paint in a new way or mapping bodies into computers with wearable computing, or using future enfolding head attachments, or making music remotely, transiently with others from everywhere, everywhen.  Hard to know whether to keep doing…but I guess I was doing before…so why stop…until I’m done.  I go to art museums and see the crazy, and I mean literally obsessive compulsive craziness all over the walls.  If I’m not obsessing about the font stroke color vr the fill color combined with background color…am I even doing it ..right?
  * unicode project could be an encyclopedia
  * Still not synched on the front page.  
  * Hmm.  I guess I needed to see what the game of thrones cast looks like without makeup.
  * I also need to confirm the name of confirmation bias.   I have that.
  * Late I see I hit devart site and went looking at the openCV and findcontours function.  Love. So many fundamentally astonishing graphics packages to choose from.  Instead, I live in the browser. I'd like to turn this into a webgl app.  But the curve has been too steep in combination with the Unicode learning.  Maybe with some extra spare time between now and July..  Although,  I’m not sure motoring through a 3-d environment full of glyphs is really all that appealing.  I’ve been looking at HTML 5 and I feel like I can do what I need without it.  Still reviewing.
  
#####Fri. February 14:
  * Made it to 9:17am before I began thinking about something other than work.  Hearts, I could make the wife a cheesy heart glyphmatic.  Went to codepoints..started…didn’t finish.  Putz.
  * Ended up at Bodewyn’s website.  Lotsa neat things on the innertubes.
  * Everybody is on github.  Where have I been?
  * Yes, deviantart. never’d been there, but its nice.
  * All right back to work.  Random forest and Naïve Bayes.  This matters but it will take a little time for the explanation.  "Boosted trees" and "gradient_tree_ boosting".  Sounds like something the forestry service could use to combat pine beetle.
  * Back to the work Unicode connection. nChar?  Did not know that.  Co-worker Dave K. a never-ending font.
  * Ran end to end ran all day and night.   I’m not ashamed to admit this makes me deeply satisfied.
  * I’m a little embarrassed to admit. I think its nutty.
  
####Sat. February 15th:
  * More updates to github.  Still not synched…sigh.  Debugging and comparing my pages to the templates to make sure I haven’t screwed it up.
  * Angular.js framework session.  Trying to figure out how I can implement some api or another to enhance.  I was stoked to find out animation is a key part of the work.  It also looks like my wife’s website that I coded in 2005 could have used some dependency injection.  But who doesn’t..really.  I don’t know what that means.
  * My spiral animations are not pre built though..Angular is all prebuilt.  
  * Maybe they’d implement one of my Bernoulli’s.."Okay..no..Yes, yes,I see.  Yes, that does seem unlikely."
  * Fun to think of these guys just following their codezen and turning it into angular.
  * Shopping!  Banner and canvas printing
  * Research into creating fonts.  UNICODE fontsets aren’t complete.  I want to make some.
  * Okay, another area that I’ll need to work at if I want to try..time.
  * And I see that watching 80 something Noam’s new video will compromise my attitude for the rest of the day.
  * Implemented new increment hex function for looping over codepoints.  WHY didn’t I do this earlier. WHY?  again Geez.
  * Tifinagh!  Research into African fonts.  Alan Wood rules.
  * Bamum, Canadian syllabics
  * Downloaded Absynnica SIL font
  * Downloaded Osmanya font
  * Ordered the picture and canvas banner finally.
  
####Sun.-Tues. February 16-18:
  * Nothing
  * Late Tuesday I came back to it with some reviewing of Alan Wood website.  Mostly South Asian.
  * Han consolidation effort is complex political and vast.  My goodness.

####Wed. February 19:
  * Webkit animation duration is first item upon re-up.
  * Looked at Vai tripper (flasher 39)  yummy

####Thurs. February 20:
  * It appears I worked all day.  Unfortunate.
  * Still not synched to front page of devart.
  * Full Urdu.  Bismullah. Nastaleeq calligraphy.  All night.
  * Only found 4 fonts that display FDFD.  Gorgeous.

####Fri. February 21:
  * Working on font coverage.  Nailed Chakma, Tai Viet, meetei mayek.  I’m the bitchenist (bitchinest?) font-finder in my kitchen this evening.  I am from Southern California, my patois includes bitchen and bitchin.
  * Took a trip to chrome experiments to help stimulate and depress me.  So freaking great.
  * Suddenly at 11:30 at night I needed to know the difference between javascript switch and case statements.  I reckon we should all review our web history more often.  A back-illuminated neo-manuscript in cookie crumbs and snail trails.  And Spiral Conch Shells, or so the Tibetan’s tell me.  
  * What happens if this show went to Bejing and I eliminate all simplified.  And mixed in a bunch of Hiragana.  Trouble. I'm trouble. 
  * Do people searching for Urdu fonts get put on the watch list?  “I only wanted to find a Bismullah glyph, man!”

####Sat. February 22:
  * Studied CSS perspective transform 
  * Looked at svg rendering.  Never heard of it—I mean heard of SVG of course but not using it as a web renderer.. Betamax? But definitely another awe-someness that I could be but amn’t doing. So many.  Used to be there was just paint, clay and stone.
  * Had body work and crazy body worker says, what about the sacred om.  All this time with the Bismullah and no sacred om?  Yes, calling me out.
  * Spent rest of day and part of Sunday pulling sacred om from as many languages as I could.  Had to compose some.  Ligatures in Balinese, Devangari and Tibet.  Composing glyphs, a satisfaction reservered (reserved for those with perseverance (Devereaux School shout out)?) for a very few who..actually care to do such a thing.  
  * Idea for engine:  fly the composition elements into center and compose syllables.  Mayan might be nice. Telugu.  Do both random and proper.  Although proper glyph presentation for the Mayan script, is work, really.
  * Finished with a review of Chinese.  Satori, Void, Heaven, God.  I think I got em.  
  * Love the subtle politics. The popular and trite "coexist" bummersticker done to the absurd.[SymbolQuad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2LVYZbcbuA "SymbolQuad") (sound).  Impossible to put this on the web unfortunately, youtoob will have to suffice.
  * Found graphemica.com.  Excellent site.  Plug in a Chinese character and it finds codepoint.  Yeehaw.
  * Yeehaw is not a technical term.
  * Worked in a deeper reading of the history of Runes in Northern Europe.
  * I believe Esparanto is written in Elder Furthak.
  * The previous statement needs a citation.
  * Eight symbols of Buddhism needs to be added to Unicode
  * Tarot needs to be added to Unicode (i-ching but not tarot? Who were these white people?)
  * Hand of Fatima needs to be added to Unicode
  * All corporate logos on the world stock exchanges should be maintained in the Unicode registry streamlining logo presentation around the web.  Use variation selectors to allow corporations to include various logos.  I can only imagine how much the Unicode consortium appreciates my advice.  Or maybe I should say, please advice.
  * Ah yes the swastika, left facing.  Tibetan swastikas with dots!  But no fonts that include…bumma
  * I think I could build the eight Tibetan elements with Chinese glyphs.  That seems wrong. Political?
  * It would be better if the glyphs existed.  Lotus kinda does, conch shell does.  Golden fish…Picses?  Not sure yet…looking at it.
  * Nymph Lotus.  I like lotus.  
  * Please see Bryggen Rune B012.  Funny
  * Really working on my font coverage.  Hate it when I can’t find fonts.  Hate it
  * Grantha,Siddham,Modi,Oriya,Assamese which led me to this dynamic discussion about Unicode and the political ramifications  http://www.unicode.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=268
  * This guy was v.e.r.y. unhappy with the Bengali name applied to Assamese language. More insight into how this irrevocably dry topic drives heated emotional debate.  As the kids don’t say, “Who didn’t know?”
  * De-escalate Please.

####Sun. February 22:
  * Visited the newly opened local Boulder retail establishment.  And yea, it was good.
  * I drink alcohol recreationally.
  * Back to Urdu.  Thought I’d see if the Saudi’s calligraphers had any bismullah’s I could coopt.  As an agnostic of christian cultural dissent, am I allowed to to do thi?  I don't know.
  * Found a font set that’s only bismullah.  Beauty.  However, its cheating by my own rules.  Font designer has overloaded the standard ascii128 characters with bismullahs.  128 of them.  Two font sets.
  * 256  bismullahs.  Should be enough.  But its cheating.  Not mapped to FDFD.  This could be partially solved with a bastard use of variation selectors!  Hack!
  * ![Bism](../project_images/bism.jpg?raw=true "Bism")
  * No, I didn’t know that the entire Arab world uses this as its most important salutation.  1.5 billion people?
  * Used glyphmatic.us to produce graphics for my entry into corporate naming contest for our new badass Teradata datawarehouse.  I picked "Forest" for the random forest big data algorithm.  Team members are the Owls.  Here’s my artwork.  ![Forest](../project_images/littleforest.jpg?raw=true "Forest") ![Owls](../project_images/littleowls.jpg?raw=true "Owls")

####Mon. February 23:
  * Added hieroglyphics and 1 mayan font to world symbols quad and mucked around with border.  For some reason the border not being set was causing terrible kerning.   Hadn’t seen that before…but fixed it with a border=1. 
  * Talked with Ran Wei, coworker of Chinese descent.  We’ve exchanged pleasantries through the work years.  Wanted his input about Han Glyphs I’d figgered to use.  He confirmed the accuracy of most, although I didn’t get infinity correct.  Not sure he knew what to make of it, kept saying interesting.  But…funny story.  At the urinal, (good place for a conversation about devart and Unicode) I bring this topic up cause I want his input.  I don’t normally hti people up for advice at the urinal, at least I didn’t. After my intorduction, he part questioningly responds “Unicode?”  But not in that awesome unknowing way like “um wtf dude‽”  More like, “did you just say Unicode?”  He responds as I fully expected he would, “I work on the Unicode project”.   
  * My people!
  * I did not expect him to say that.
  * So you see the ancient question remain: “While Unicode isn’t life and life isn’t Unicode, if you don’t use Unicode, do you have a life?
  * Once again we are required to inform you that this is a Monte Python gag and that isn’t an ancient question.  Of course you don’t.
  * Wrote this long-assed, long-winded recounting of my two-week google promulgated “scholarly” indulgence.
  
####Tues. February 24:
  * Procrastination is also pernicious.  Did not get any editing done on snailthread.   Weak minds seldom prevail.
  * Took degenererator1b which had been 8 divs over a container div and reduced it to 2divs to make it less messy.  Also changed color pallet.  A picture of which, no serious music lover should be without.  At least serious music lovers who really dig music from late Byzantia.
  * Mentioned above Feb 5th.
  
   [Byzantia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BENopqacUE "Byzantium Music Symbols"). 
  


####Wed. February 25:
  * Hieroglyphics day.  Again with degnerator1.  Created a pretty,refined look with no messiness Heiroline.
  * Then blew out the fill width to create heirolinesplat.
  * Sent thumb drive off with zedi.  Didn’t much like the bismullah quad.  We’ll see if he gives to bro.  Sent a couple o' hundred screenshots.

####Thurs. February 26:
  * Decided I need some sound on my youtube slideshows. 
  
  * Splatheiroline (sound)
  * [SplatHeiroLine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQju-ncDoQI "SplatHeiroLine") 
  
####Fri. February 27: 
  * worked three more loops  
  * Links included above except for this one
  
  * Electrick Mandala (sound)
   [Electrick Mandala](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BENopqacUE "Electrick Mandala")

  * Heiroline61 (sound)
   [Heiroline61](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7YIvVRK4ik "Heiroline61")
   
  * Heiroline
   [Heiroline](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OgLMcnzyWw "Heiroline")

  

####Sun. March 2: 
  * Submit journal for February.  
  * Not sure the whole owls idea was that well received‽
  * As always, you can hit glyphmatic.us.  Let it run.  Its want to run all the time.  Trust me.
