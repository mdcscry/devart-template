I use Unicode, Chrome, Webkit, js/css/html and the random function of javascript to generatively produce WebArt. 
This is a Chrome experiment.  It is a restriction study in the sense that I've chosen to produce all code client side-modifying all and creating many through runtime DOM.  Nothing too fancy, that's the point.  I've created 10-15 engines with 100+ variants in 2013-2014.  The hope is reveal this exploration through the remainder of the conference.

I produced this version of the website in July.  My original htm weren't gerneralized.  I grew wary of the cut and paste and wanted to build a framework to generate all the pages.  This took a good bit of effort and has ended up untenable.  Recent versions of Chrome rendered some pages inoperable.  Also, the variable nature of font sets across platforms is, to put it charitably, an undertaking.

I began using random on an Apple 2+ in 1983.  I built a stocks and bonds game.  My smart cousin figured out that the random generator on that computer used the same sequence each time the program started.  I've been hooked on random since. I created 4 projects in the early 2000's which I'll comment on in blogs.  Glyphmatic.us is a furthering of that work using the vast palette of Unicode.
