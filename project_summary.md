I use Chrome, Webkit, js/css/html and the Math.random() to generatively produce webArt, a variant of DevArt and a non-existing category.  

Unicode is the palette, Chrome is the Canvas.  Glyphmatic.us reveals and celebrates the unending richness of global hu(wo)manities glyphsets.

This *is* a Chrome Experiment, but works in Safari. 

A question for you:
Is Chrome a museum worthy platform for artistic expression?
