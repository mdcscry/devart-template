I use Unicode, Chrome, Webkit, js/css/html and the random function of javascript to generatively produce WebArt. 
This is a Chrome experiment.  It is a restriction study in the sense that I've chosen to produce all code client side-modifying all and creating many objects including stylesheets through runtime DOM.  Nothing too fancy, that's the point.  The code is the proxy for the exhibition of Unicode splendor. I've created 10-15 engines with 100+ variants in 2013-2014.  The hope is to reveal this exploration through the remainder of the competition.

I produced the current version of the website in July.  My original htm weren't generalized.  As the numbers approached 50 I grew weary of cut and paste and set out to build a framework to generate the pages.  After completing 3 different engines the complexity of the approach become untenable.  Recent versions of Chrome have rendered some formatting inserts inoperable.  They work on Android Nexus 5 Chrome browser but not windows 7 Chrome.   Also, the variable nature of font-sets installed across platforms is, to put it charitably, an undertaking to troubleshoot.

The fonts required for the complete project will be introduced along the way.  Symbola and Code2000 are vital.
I've tried to optimize some pages using only glyphs supported in Arial MS Unicode.  That was Until I realized only those users with office installed could use it without paying. That leaves only the barely adequate deja vu sans as a viable Unicode font option for new windows machines without office.

UNICODE is the lingua franca of the internet.  It represents a compendium of humanities glyph technology.  I argue its creation and adoption is such an achievement that no set of glyphs could adequately describe the importance of the glyphs themselves.  This is a project of world cultural and humanitarian celebration.  I'll delve into this history.

I began using random on an Apple 2+ in 1983.  I built a computer version of a favorite bookcase game -- Stocks and Bonds bookcase game.  I've been hooked on random since. I created 4 projects in the early 2000's which I'll comment on in postints.  Glyphmatic.us is a furth'u'ring of that work, using the vast palette of Unicode.
