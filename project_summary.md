I use Chrome, Webkit, js/css/html and the Math.random() to generatively produce webArt, a variant of DevArt and a non-existing category.  

Unicode is the palette, Chrome is the Canvas.  Glyphmatic.us reveals and celebrates the unending richness of global hu(wo)manities glyphsets.

This *is* a Chrome Experiment, but works in Safari. 

A question for you:
Is Chrome a museum worthy platform for artistic expression?

<H3>Code:</H3>
It's a restriction study in the sense that I've chosen to produce all code on the client side.  All objects are modified and many are created at runtime.  Some experiments have thousands of <DIV></DIV> elements, all generated.  Its not exactly cutting edge coding. Repeating many of the same principles throughout, the variability is in the many little algorithms (AllGoRythms) to produce random change, that's interesting....at least that I find interesting--so far I'm the only one lookin..  The blend of CSS and Webkit transformations are well known features of the various standards.  Searching around, I found few serious use-cases: more than a few "here's what it look like" jsfiddles, but not many real applications.  Maybe the inherent cheesiness of saturation scares people away.  :)  But what I think makes Glyphmatic.us "important" isn't the code.  The code is proxy to reveal Unicode's richness.  That's why I'm here.

I produced the current version of the website in July.  The original "studies" weren't generalized, I was building and saving.  As the numbers approached 50, I grew weary of cut and paste and set out to build a framework to generate the pages.  As part of this project, I've done some rework and now have a stable version more or less working on Android Windows and Apple, chrome and safari.  Webkit.  For now, browswer compliance to mozilla, IE and opera feels like work.

The fonts required for the complete project will be introduced along the way.  Symbola and Code2000 are vital.  Some languages are only located on specific fonts.  For a public display, any computer can be set up. I'm looking at some screen capture tech to provide a sense, but so far its been unusable.
I've tried to optimize some pages using only glyphs supported in Arial MS Unicode. After looking at Android, Windows 7 and Windows 8 I had to pare back the fontset.  Font set installation is definitely the flaw in the fly's ointment for Glyphmatic.us.

UNICODE is the lingua franca of the internet.  It represents a compendium of humanities glyph technology.  I argue its creation and adoption is such an achievement that no set of glyphs could adequately describe the importance of the glyphs themselves.  And that right there is some pretty hot recursive glyph action. This is a project of world cultural and humanitarian celebration.  I'll delve into the UNICODE story and some of the stories associated to different font sets.

<H3>Hist:</H3>
I began using random in Applesoft basic on an Apple 2+ in 1983.  I built a computer version of a favorite bookcase game -- Stocks and Bonds bookcase game.  My mom predates me.  She built a football game with random plays in a programming class at Saddleback college. Soon, thereafter she appeared with an Apple 2 summarily replace by an Apple 2+.  

To further establish my awesome bones fides, we used a modem to receive the basketball box scores for the PCAA, an athletic conference in California.  She built a program that allowed me to text enter the scores, and compute the league averages to be distributed to the regional papers including Orange County Register and the LA Times.  We were kewl.  Also,  I was an early IT drone.  Thanks Ma. 

I've been hooked on random since. 

1992, in Tulsa Oklahoma, I created wEIERDS.  wEIRDS randomly assembled new words.  I collect roots like plode, ject, vert to be combined with prefixes and suffixes.  Fortunately for me, words are cheap. For a year or so after I annoyed the crap out of anyone within earshot, wowing any and all assembled guests with my computational bravado (150 Million wEIRDS, woot).  I intend to recreate that project within the Glyphmatic.us framework.  Here's a link www.eschaton-bros.com from the wayback machine. http://web.archive.org/web/19991012072542/http://www.eschaton-bros.com/weirds/weirds.html It isn't pretty, but you can see I thought was funny in 1998-99.  Not that you care, Da Freq, who built the dead applet, Weagul and Bitrot still roam.  Weagul is Seelight on quora.

I created 4 projects in the 2002-2004 timeframe. Glyphmatic.us is a furthuring of that work. I created an IE system called newArt with no DOM manipulation.  I randomly used the IE filters, and IE still has some bitchin filters.  The first stab was in perl on the messagemedia servers(dead email marketing company bought by doubleclick bought by google.) then later with a JSP framework.  

I rebuilt weirds using the same JSP javabean framework.  Immediately I began another digitization. This time of a random poietry project called blatherJazz.  No,really it was Blather Jazz, but this is a coder competition.  I collected 10000+ english bits, cliches, turns of phrase, interesting words and assembled them in a properly punctuated and spaced run-time generated style-sheet displayed poietry.  I always remember "Fiddlesticks" as an excellent speciman. Herein, an example. Blather Jazz would combine fiddlesticks with the aforementioned "thereafter" to make "Fiddlesticks, thereafter!". I even flagged the naughty phrases and words so I could select for a naughtier Blather.  

Around the same time I built a style sheet generator for frequentflyers.org and sharedhistory.org.  I designed the framework of the pages, and then generated random style sheets for the pages. Refreshing ad nauseum, but never puking.  I then tested in all the different browsers, generating different font color combinations and stored all this in mysql.  http://web.archive.org/web/20020325013313/http://frequentflyers.org/  

One other piece of the puzzle was a single page website I built for http://frequentlyers.org in 2003-2004.  I learned and practiced of switching content through DOM, so popular today.  This site is still working perfectly on the Wayback machine http://web.archive.org/web/20060427163816/http://www.frequentflyers.org/.  In 2003 when I put newArt to sleep, (the free JSP server went away), I stated to my friend jrenwick@goo[g]le.com, that I wanted to rework using Unicode.  He vaguely remembers this.  I'm quite clear.  That notion sat idle for 10 years until January 2013.  I attended the Microstrategy World Conference in Las Vegas, when 2 guys from Facebook showed how they hacked javascript in MSTR.  What they did was fairly simple, based on what I knew from above experience, *but* the room fluttered in amazement.  I got steamed.  Which tells you something about me, I guess, literally thinking, I'll show these guys "hacked" javascript. Which I didn't do, but I'm showing you.
